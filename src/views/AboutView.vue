      <p>
        Hi! I'm Camille. I have a uniquely varied mix of experience in
        management, customer relations, design, and developmentâ€“now I'm pursuing
        a career change into software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        I love the challenges coding provides, and the endless learning and
        growth inherit to it. I'm a bootcamp and self-taught developer with a
        litany of transferable skills and a strong desire to succeed (but that's
        all in my resume, linked below).
      </p>
      <p>
        I devour content, whether it's new tech knowledge, a niche anime, a
        newly-found fantasy book, or an interesting new cocktail recipe to shake
        up. And while I wouldn't say I'm always in the gym, fitness is important
        to me, as is satisfying my insatiable sweet tooth.
      </p>
